# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 27, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Beginning to create a brute force cracker with C++. 

> **Thoughts:** I really struggled with function and logic behind it all, espescially the recursion part. I'm already quite familiar with the basic syntax.

> **Link to work:** unfinished

### Day 1: October 28, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Finalized the brute force cracker, though there is one bug where the program won't return even if it cracked the password. Created a tribute page for Captain Disillusion.

> **Thoughts:** I spent a good amount of time trying to fix the Brute Force attacker bug, and I will solve that in the future. It was quite a heavy problem, and with the limited C++ syntax I have, it would be better to first learn more C++. Inspired by the freecodecamp projects, I created a tribute page for Captain Disillusion, one of my favorite YouTubers. I did this since I haven't coded in HTML/CSS in a while.

### Day 2: October 29, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Created the first prototype of my MadLibs Generator. 

> **Thoughts:** It's been quite a long time since I coded in Javascript, so I decided to refresh my memory by creating a MadLibs generator. Refamiliarizing myself with the DOM and event listeners was a struggle. My code is also a bit messy. The project is obviously unfinished, and I aim to finish it tomorrow. Had quite a bit of fun creating the MadLibs sentences though.

### Day 3: October 30, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Finished my MadLibs generator, and created a website for NYSO. 

> **Thoughts:** I rushed quite a bit for the MadLibs generator, mostly because I wasn't really feeling it. The website I made for NYSO wasn't really that great too - it was merely a prototype, albeit inspired from some websites I found online. I really need to spend more time with C++ however, and tomorrow I'll try to fix my brute force cracker and try to implement it in Javascript.

### Day 4: October 31, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Created an asteroids game with Gamemaker Studio 2 (Followed tutorial) and a console calculator with C++. 

> **Thoughts:** Today was a wreck. My wifi wasn't working and I wasn't feeling so well. I haven't used Gamemaker in months, so coding in it feels somewhat nostalgic. I'll definitely use it in the future again, but for now I really need to focus on my C++ project.

### Day 5: November 1, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Created the basics of my DevLog.io website plan

> **Thoughts:** Today was as much as a wreck as yesterday, except multiplied by one thousand. I'm still dealing with grief over some private family matters, and I have to prepare for a science competition I'm joinning tomorrow. However, I still managed to create the basics of my website.

### Day 6: November 2, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Begin the creation of Devlog IO, FreeCodeCamp challenges, C++ practice in SoloLearn

> **Thoughts:** I applied what I learned in a Data Structures course by using OOP to integrate posts and users for my website. As far as I remember, this is the first time I've used OOP for something 'useful.' I'm quite proud of what I've achieved today especially considering my current emotional state. I've also practiced some Javascript and C++, which was awesome.

### Day 7: November 3, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Began learning Django, watched some MOOC lectures (Harvard CS50 & Web Programming)

> **Thoughts:** Learning Django made me realize how clueless I was about all this stuff. I knew the Syntax, but not the theory behind it. Tomorrow, I'll watch some Web Development lectures by Harvard's CS50 team and try to use Flask which some people say will make me understand Django more. I will also do some challenges on FreeCodeCamp, if I have the time.

### Day 8: November 4, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Learned Flask, created Note-taking app

> **Thoughts:** Flask was, in retrospect, much easier to learn than Django. I even managed to create a simple note taking app with it. Harvard's Web Dev course and Corey Schafer's videos were essential in helping me understand this language. I think I'm going to use Flask for my devlog io project, but I'll have to make sure.

### Day 9: November 5, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Learned WTForms in Flask, and a bit of SQL.

> **Thoughts:** Didn't get much done today, which is acceptable since I'm still in the grieving process for my cousin. Currently working on Devlog io.

### Day 10: November 7, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Created the form for Devlog io

> **Thoughts:** Finally created the form! took me like an hour to solve a bug, but failing is a part of programming, and solving that bug felt like getting a new car. 1/10th of my way there, and I'm so excited.

### Day 11: November 8, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Added functionality to the forms

> **Thoughts:** Hello Singapore, hello vacation! Today I added functionality to the forms so that users can actually post something, and began learning SQL and SQLAlchemy.

___ 

### Day 12: November 12, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Created a database, and models for the database

> **Thoughts:** Today I finalized the models, wrote my first tests, and created a database. It was a struggle since I honestly didn't know what I was doing. Tomorrow, I'll learn the package structure and visit the basics of SQL and databases.
