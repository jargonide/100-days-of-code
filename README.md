# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 27, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Beginning to create a brute force cracker with C++. 

> **Thoughts:** I really struggled with function and logic behind it all, espescially the recursion part. I'm already quite familiar with the basic syntax.

> **Link to work:** unfinished

### Day 1: October 28, 2018 

> **Today's Progress**: Finalized the brute force cracker, though there is one bug where the program won't return even if it cracked the password. Created a tribute page for Captain Disillusion.

> **Thoughts:** I spent a good amount of time trying to fix the Brute Force attacker bug, and I will solve that in the future. It was quite a heavy problem, and with the limited C++ syntax I have, it would be better to first learn more C++. Inspired by the freecodecamp projects, I created a tribute page for Captain Disillusion, one of my favorite YouTubers. I did this since I haven't coded in HTML/CSS in a while.
